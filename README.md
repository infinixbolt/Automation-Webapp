# Cypress Test Automation

This repository contains a collection of test automation scenarios implemented using the Cypress test framework. The tests in this repository are designed to showcase functional, UI, and API test automation. They cover a wide range of common and frequently encountered functionality found on the web, including some challenging and complex scenarios.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to serve as a platform for practicing test automation techniques and demonstrating how to write effective tests using Cypress. It provides real-world examples of testing various web functionalities and showcases best practices for test organization, assertions, and reporting.

## Features

- Functional tests: Covers end-to-end testing of various web functionalities, user interface, and user interactions.
- API tests: Demonstrates testing of APIs and backend functionalities.
- Challenging scenarios: Includes tests for complex scenarios that require careful handling.
